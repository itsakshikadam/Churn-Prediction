# Churn-Prediction
Bank Churn Prediction
A Machine Learning project aimed at predicting customer churn in the banking sector. By analyzing customer data and identifying patterns indicative of churn, this model helps banks proactively retain at-risk customers and maintain revenue streams.

#Problem Statement
Customer churn significantly impacts a bank's profitability. This project builds a predictive model to accurately forecast whether a customer is likely to leave the bank. Early identification enables the bank to implement targeted retention strategies, minimizing revenue loss and enhancing customer satisfaction.

#Features
1.Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
2.Imbalanced Data Handling: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
3.Data Preprocessing: One-hot encoding, StandardScaler for feature scaling.
4.Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
5.Interactive Prediction Tool: A user-friendly interface to input customer data and receive churn predictions.
